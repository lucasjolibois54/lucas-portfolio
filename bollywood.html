    <h2 class="project-about">What the project was about:</h2>
    <p class="project-about-p">This project was a 4-week theme course consisting of two parts of 2 weeks. The first part was the bollywood dance school and the second part was a ballet dance school which I have included it as a project for itself. In the first part of the theme course, we were a web agency that had been tasked with developing a digital product for a specific user segment with focus on the basic principles of design and programming for a Bollywood dance school.</p>

                <p class="project-about-p">This given target group was the different user segments that had a special interest in dances such as bollywood dances. From here we had to specify the target group ourselves depending on our developed concept.</p>

        <h2 class="project-about">roles:</h2>
        <p class="project-about-p">Throughout most of the project, we worked with a lot of teamwork, therefore most of the project was made collectively, however, once again we divided team roles to each other so that we could create a better structure and clarity along the way. My roles were design manager, communicator and idea man. In addition to this, we were all responsible for one page each on the website. I was responsible for the events page, which I have created, coded and designed myself.</p>

        <h2 class="project-about">Target group after our research:</h2>
        <p class="project-about-p">Our final target group was women aged 25+, preferably with children or the desire to have a family. They live in big cities and socializing is important to them. They are culturally liberal and happy for new inputs. They have a busy day, so they are looking for a leisure activity that is easily accessible and not too time consuming. If it is possible to combine activities with their children, it will be preferable. Their information search takes place primarily on the web and they value good reviews highly. They are active on social media, such as Instagram and Facebook.</p>

        <h2 class="project-about">Our concept:</h2>
        <p class="project-about-p">Bollywood Sway is a newly started dance school in Copenhagen. They offer dance lectures in an informal and beginner-friendly universe. It has to be fun to go to take dance lectures at Bollywood Sway and you do not need any other background in dance to be able to start.
            Several of the inquiries that they have received are from women who are looking for an alternative for other training activities that are offered, such as zumba, spinning etc.
            The dance school is therefore not necessarily for people who’s very dance oriented, but more like people who want to have fun, get their heart rate up and have a free space with like-minded people.
            In addition to the regular lectures offered for women, there will now be an extra team where you have the opportunity to take your children with you. The tempo is slowed down a bit and the focus is more on the dance as a game and connecting with others throughout the dance.
            This is also intended as an alternative for those who are interested in joining dance classes, but may have a hard time finding the time, due to their children.
            In addition, there will also be various events and workshops so that people can come and get a taste of the universe, without having to sign up and start out with the real dance lessons.
            The website will reflect a relaxed and colorful sense of community and it should be clear and easy to use.
