    <h2 class="project-about">What the project was about:</h2>
    <p class="project-about-p">This project was a 4-week theme course in which we focused on developing a concept regarding branding of cars, and then developing a sales platform for our concept. In addition to this, we also had to further develop a business concept in order to be able to market and brand ourselves on social media.</p>

                <p class="project-about-p">This given target group was students, from here we had to further develop the target group ourselves depending on our concept.</p>

        <h2 class="project-about">roles:</h2>
        <p class="project-about-p">Throughout the project we worked with teamwork, so the majority of the project was made collectively. However, we distributed team roles to each other so that we could have better structure and clarity along the way. My roles were the communicator and the idea man. I was also responsible for the marketing strategy on social media, the website setup and more. We were all responsible for one page on the website. I was responsible for the home page, which I've created, coded and designed myself.</p>

        <h2 class="project-about">Target group after our research:</h2>
        <p class="project-about-p">Our target group is students who have been working on the labor market before returning to their studies in college/ university. Our target group is therefore primarily students who have some savings, or students that have a job next to their education. We primarily focus on students who depend on public transport to get to and from their institutions and who spend more time on transport than the average student.</p>

        <h2 class="project-about">Our concept:</h2>
        <p class="project-about-p">Our koncept was a leasing company that leases cars exclusively to students, where they can drive up to 30,000 km / year at a price equivalent to 15,000 km / year. If you drive more than 30,000, you’ll have to pay extra, as the student car is designed for use to and from school and nothing else. On the website, it is possible to book a free consultation to get an insight into whether you can afford it or not, and whether it is worth it regarding the amount of kilometers you need.</p>
