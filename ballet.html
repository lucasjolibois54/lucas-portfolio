    <h2 class="project-about">What the project was about:</h2>
    <p class="project-about-p">This project was a 4-week theme course consisting of two parts of 2 weeks. The first part was the bollywood dance school which I have included in a project for itself, and the second part was a ballet dance school which is this project. In part two, there was a lot of focus on iterations in the design process. The project was to test and further develop the digital product made by another group from part one. We therefore had to work with a new user segment based on the data / product another group has produced. The challenge is, among other things, to build on the work of others. The project started with a handover meeting.</p>

        <p class="project-about-p">Throughout most of the project, we worked with teamwork, therefore we were common about the majority of the project, however, we again divided team roles to each other so that we could create a better structure over clarity along the way. My roles were design manager, communicator and idea man wherein i also was responsible for the logo and along other things. In addition to this, we all got the responsibility for each of our pages on the website. I was responsible for the classes section, which I’ve created, coded and designed myself.</p>

        <h2 class="project-about">Target group after our research:</h2>
        <p class="project-about-p">After our desk research, we defined a new target group. It dawned on us that children's classes are primarily offered at most ballet dance schools. There are also classes for adults, but these are more students who have been at their dance school for a number of years, rather than people who started as a newbie in their adult lives. In addition, there is a large majority of girls who take ballet classes. Ballet is a prestigious dance with a lot of history and discipline. It is internationally recognized and offered to a greater extent in most countries. Our target group is therefore defined as girls aged from 4-17 years. They live in the bigger cities in their country and they come from middle to upper class families as equipment, hours, etc. are not on the cheap end. These are girls who like the competition element and who like to see progression in their results rather than just doing it for fun. Since our primarily target group is children, our secondary target group is their parents. They are the ones who ultimately use the website to choose and by lessons.

        <h2 class="project-about">Our concept:</h2>
        <p class="project-about-p">Ballet By Birgitte is a ballet school specifically created for girls between 4 and 17 years. It is a dance school where the dance and the history of the dance is taken very seriously and it is planned that you may at some point participate in competitions and events. In our product we wanted to create a website that shows just that and more. We wanted to give people a feel of the dance. The website from the group we took over was in black and white. Looked more like an expensive chocolate website rather than a ballet school, ergo we had to come up with a design that gives the expression of a ballet school.
