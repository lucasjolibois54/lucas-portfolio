    <p class="project-about-p">This was my first theme project and the first website that I have developed. The project was to develop a concept for a fictional space travel program. Ergo, we had to develop a concept and a digital solution in relation to the sale of travel into space.</p>

        <h2 class="project-about">Target group after our research:</h2>
        <p class="project-about-p">Our target group in this project was primarily people from the blue segment of the minerva model. These are people who are materialistic and modern and who are employed in the private sector. Preferably people that earn more than the average resident. For that reason we think that our target group is people such as rich people, businessmen and- or celebrities.
